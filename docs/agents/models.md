Before delegating work or choosing a model or effort, read this.

## Models and effort

[`dev/models.ts`](../../dev/models.ts) is the single source of truth for which model and effort each kind of work uses,
in two modes: **normal** (Claude only) and **withCodex** (Codex is the workhorse, Claude is saved for Opus). `npm run models` prints the active mode and its table; read that rather than a copy of it anywhere else.

- **Switching:** `codexFrom` in `dev/models.ts` is the local date withCodex starts (null: stay normal). Only the owner
  switches modes; an agent that hits a Codex limit in withCodex mode pauses and tells the owner.
- **Enforcement:** in normal mode `dev/codex/run.ts` and `npm run queue` refuse Codex jobs except previz, which is
  still tried because only Codex paints; at a limit, images wait and the owner is told. The `planner` and `implementer`
  frontmatter must match `agents` in `dev/models.ts` (`test/models.test.ts`).
- **Effort at spawn:** where a route names an effort different from the agent's frontmatter (high-risk implementation),
  pass it as the Agent tool's `effort`. Opus `max` only when the owner asks.
- **Normal-mode brainstorm:** run the three panelists as Claude subagents, each given its role file from
  `.claude/skills/brainstorm/roles/`, then synthesize as usual.
- **Daily jobs** (`dev/daily/jobs.ts`) stay on Codex; at a limit they fail and report rather than spend Claude usage
  unattended.
- **Changing a route:** edit `dev/models.ts` and record the owner's words in
  [owner-calls](owner-calls.md#owners-standing-calls), "Models and effort".
